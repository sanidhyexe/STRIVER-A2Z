# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

# You should return the array of nums such that the array follows the given conditions:

# Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
# For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
# The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
# Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
# Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
# Explanation:
# The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
# The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
# Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions
